## Testing Information

## Node Operators

Please coordinate with us to register your validator set with our registry service. We will provide
you with the necessary information to get started.

## Validators

Connecting to the relay without being registered will result in your validator operating correctly
so long as MEV Boost is also running.

## Holesky Information

## Builders and searchers

secure enough, please reach out to us.
